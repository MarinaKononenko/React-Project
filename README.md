# Kanban Board React Project

This project is a Kanban board implemented using React. It allows you to manage tasks and track their progress through different stages. The board consists of four blocks: Backlog, Ready, In progress, and Finished.

## Installation and Setup

To run the React application, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory. 
- Install the dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
- Start the development server with `npm start`.
- Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the Kanban board.

## Functional Requirements

1. Adding a New Task

    - Clicking the "+ Add card" button in the Backlog section should display an input field at the end of the task list, between the last task and the button.
    
    - The "+ Add card" button should change to "Submit" when the input field appears.

    - Add Task Algorithm:

        1. Click the "+ Add card" button.
        2. An input field for task title appears. 
        3. Enter the task title.
        4. Click the "Submit" button.
        5. The task is added to the Backlog section if the title is provided.
        6. If the title is empty, nothing is added to the list.
        
2. Moving Tasks between Lists

    - Clicking the "+ Add card" button in the Ready section should display a dropdown menu at the end of the task list, containing tasks from the Backlog section.

    - Selecting a task from the dropdown menu should add it to the Ready section as the last task and remove it from the Backlog section.

    - Note: The same principle applies to moving tasks between In progress and Finished sections.
    
3. Saving Changes

    - Any changes made to the application (adding new tasks, moving tasks between lists, modifying task descriptions) should be saved in the browser's localStorage.

    - When the application is loaded, the tasks stored in localStorage should be displayed (or empty lists if nothing is stored). If changes are made and the page is refreshed, the changes should persist.
    
4. Task Detail Page

    - Clicking on the title of a task in the task list should allow the user to navigate to a separate detail page for that task.

## Conclusion

The Kanban board React project provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing tasks and tracking their progress. By following the functional requirements, you can implement the necessary features and ensure the application behaves as expected. Have fun building your Kanban board!
